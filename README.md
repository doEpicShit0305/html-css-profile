HTML and CSS Concepts
HTML Concepts Involved:
Semantic HTML:

Usage of appropriate HTML tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, <nav>, and <article> for better content organization and SEO optimization.
Forms:

A simple form is included in the Contact section to collect user input (name, email, subject, and message).
Navigation:

Implemented smooth scroll for internal links to navigate to different sections of the page.
Image Optimization:

Responsive images are included using <img> tags with alt attributes for better accessibility.
Carousel:

A simple carousel is added in the About section to cycle through different content slides (e.g., Education, Career, Hobbies).
CSS Concepts Involved:
Flexbox:

Flexbox is used for layout management in the Projects section to ensure that the project cards are well-aligned and responsive.
Media Queries:

Media queries are utilized to make the website responsive for different screen sizes (mobile-first design). Example breakpoints used:
max-width: 900px: Changes the layout for tablet devices.
max-width: 600px: Adjusts for mobile screens.
Transitions and Hover Effects:

Smooth transitions and hover effects are applied to the project cards to improve user interaction.
Typography and Layout:

The website uses consistent typography for headings and body text, ensuring readability. Proper margins and padding are used for content spacing.
Grid and Flexbox for Layout:

Flexbox is used to handle the layout of the header and the project section, ensuring flexibility when resizing.
CSS Grid is applied in certain sections to create clean, structured layouts.
Button Styling:

Custom button styles are applied, including hover and focus states to improve user experience.
